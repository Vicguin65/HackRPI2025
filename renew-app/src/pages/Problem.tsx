            Renewable energy served as our primary inspiration. Our goal is to promote cleaner energy for a more sustainable world, and we recognize that one of the key challenges in adopting renewable energy is determining whether solar panel installation offers a worthwhile return on investment, given that the benefits can vary significantly between homes.

            We developed this project using React for the front end, combining it with the TypeScript template for type safety and scalability. The Google Places API was used to gather precise location data, while the Google Solar API provided information on solar potential based on geographic and environmental data. The appâ€™s UI and logic were built to create a smooth user experience, allowing users to search for places and view solar data efficiently.            </div>
