Albayanos are deprived from the resources extracted from own yard because the power distributor in Albay not allowed to avail direct transmission from the two geothermal plants.

High power rates is disadvantageous to Albayanos because it discourage potential investors. The economy is highly affected. The City Government of Legaspi is most interested in solar and wind energy sources. Geothermal also another alternative choice because some portion part of Legazpi City particularly the upper part of Barangay Buenavista is declared geothermal reserve due to its proximity to the existing BacMan Geothermal Plant of AboitizPower.  Hydropower is not highly feasible due to lack of sufficient volume of elevated surface water source, but small scale hydropower is feasible in the City, especially micro-hydroelectric plants that have a capacity of less than 0.1 MW (100 kW), may mitigate adverse side effects and be a cost-effective way to bring electricity to rural and off-the-grid communities.

The intent of the study was to layout the best way to add renewable energy to city-owned properties and to explore 100% renewable energy by 2050.   Projects to add solar PV to municipal-owned property resulting from the study are currently under development at Jackson Pike and Southerly Wastewater Treatment Plants.Residential and commercial renewable energy adoption targets are outlined in sections 7.1 - 7.2 “Increase On-Site Solar” in the Sustainable Columbus 2021 Climate Action Plan. The Climate Action Plan increases the renewable energy targets to 200 MW installed at municipal sites by 2030 and 2 GW total municipal and private installations by 2050.

The roof of the building contains a solar array under a power purchase agreement containing 2,600 panels with ~0.668 MW or 668 kW generation capacity.  The Fleet PV array at 4211 Groves Rd produced 698,005 kWh in 2022 vs. total use 2,045,034 kWh. This is 34% the annual site kWh energy requirements. The second installation is located on the Wyandot Lodge, a Columbus Recreation & Parks facility constructed in 2017 that included the PV array from the beginning. The array contains 80 panels which total ~0.0258 MW or 25.8 kW of generation for this 5,249 SF facility.  The new Linden Community Center has a rooftop array of 180 solar panels donated to the City for $1. This 43.2 kW array generates about 81,000 kWh of energy per year, covering 10 - 15% of the property's total kWh needs. Total City PV estimate currently operating at all three sites is 0.737 MW or 737.0 kW. As of May 31, 2023, the Department Finance & Management is evaluating a 187.5 kW rooftop solar PV installation which would offset ~12% (258,840 kWh) of the annual site kWh requirements for a 21,470 square foot site. Finally, the Department of Public Utilities is in the early stages of investigating additional utility-scale projects at the Dublin Road, Hap Cremean, & Parsons Water Treatment Plants.Two utility-scale projects to add solar PV to municipal-owned property are currently under development at Jackson Pike Wastewater Treatment Plant and Parsons Water Treatment Plant.

The new PDAP will be voted on in November 2023 and will cover the period from 2024 to 2030.The plan is based on three main axes, namely employee commuting, professional trips, and travel related to the administration's operations. The goal of the PDAP is decarbonizing mobility. This means reducing the carbon footprint of travel and encouraging more environmentally friendly modes of transportation.The plan proposes a set of measures, including:- Reducing and decarbonizing the fleet of vehicles used by the administrations.- Promoting bicycle use as a means of transportation.- Improving incentives for employees to favor sustainable transportation modes.- Creating remote working spaces to reduce the need for business travel.- Strengthening controls on delivery methods used for the City's purchases.- Experimenting with decarbonized delivery methods for the last mile of deliveries.Between 2008 and 2022, the City of Paris reduced the number of vehicles by 15.7%, taking into account the creation of new services (25.7% without considering these new additions). In 2022, the fleet consisted of 2,575 vehicles, including the creation of new services related to the reform of public order and the transfer of vehicles from the Prefecture of Police.

It is an exceptional opportunity for the modernisation and decarbonisation of the heating sector in Prague. The project will use low-potential heat from both water lines of treated wastewater at the WWTP using a series of heat pumps. A design study had identified the most suitable site in the immediate vicinity of the treatment plant. The land is owned by the City of Prague. For the power of heat pumps, a flow rate of about 3 m3/s can be used to cool the wastewater by 10 °C or more and thus obtain more than 180 MW of heat output, which corresponds to a heat supply of 2 x 830 thousand GJ/year, i.e. heat of 90 to 95 °C for about 83 thousand households. In May 2023, Pražská plynárenská a.s. also presented Strategy for the Heating and Decarbonisation of the Capital City of Prague. This  city-owned company proposes three paths to new green heat sources: a 200 MWt Energocentrum, water/water heat pumps on the Vltava River with a capacity of approx. 100 MWt, and increased use of waste in heat and electricity production at the Malešice ZEVO. ZEVO Malešice has the potential to provide up to twice as much heat output as today, and apparently at significantly lower prices than the coal-fired power plant in Mělník. Thus, by 2036, Pražská plynárenská would reduce CO2 production in the energy and heating sector by 60%.Another priority was the establishment of the Prague Renewable Energy Community (PSOE). As the sharing of electricity between the members of the community is not yet anchored in czech legislation, Prague has concluded a Memorandum  that replaces the sharing by the valuation of the value of the overflows of electricity from the community member's generation plant by the electricity supplier PRE and the projection of the values of these overflows into the discounted price of power electricity supplied to the customer sites with PV generation.

Cities 2023,54370,Municipal Council of Penang,,Malaysia,Southeast Asia,No,No,public,2,Food target,Target to increase sustainable agricultural practices in food production,"Generally, Penang does not face the issue of food deserts or food insecurity. Although agriculture contributes only around 2% to Penang’s GDP, it is nevertheless an important sector for delivering food security in Penang. Currently, Penang’s agricultural land accounts for around 40% of the landmass although it has been declining steadily and is expected to continue to decline going forward. The agriculture sector consists of 3 subsectors: crop farming, livestock farming and fishery. Together, they provide a rich local selection of produce and contribute to Penang’s reputation as a ‘food haven’. There is currently no reliable data on the breakdown of locally-produced and imported food, although there is an assumption that Penang will increasingly rely on imported food due to land issues.The main food crop grown in Penang is rice with most of the paddy fields located on the Mainland. In 2016, Penang was in the top three states that recorded the highest rice production per annum in Malaysia although it increasingly depends on rice import from countries like Thailand and Vietnam. Penang also imports most of the vegetables and fruits consumed locally. Penang produces not enough ruminant (cow and goat) products, which are more land intensive. In terms of fishery, Penang is one of the main contributors of marine aquaculture products in Malaysia, a large part of which are for the export market. Conversely, marine catches and seafood harvest (including cockles) have declined.Challenges in Penang’s agriculture is the understanding on the concept of food security which currently only focusing on the self-sufficiency level (SSL) of main agricultural products, rather than keeping track of food safety, affordability and accessibility, and nutritional intake. As Penang continues to urbanize and the value of land rises, it is very tempting for farmers to convert agriculture land, both legally and illegally. Major livestock products in Penang are poultry and pigs, the production of which exceeds the demand of Penang’s current population –over 100% of SSL.","Larger - covers the whole jurisdiction and adjoining areas, please explain additions",2019,2019,Question not applicable,,,,,,Question not applicable,No,the self-sufficiency level (SSL) of main agricultural products is evaluated to measure the progress of this activity,794313,2020,,04/03/2024 08:02:05 PM

The first step to reducing transportation emissions is to reduce the number of miles traveled in private cars by facilitating a transition to other modes of transportation, like Metrorail, Metrobus, trolley, walking, rolling, or biking. To facilitate this shift, we must utilize land use and transportation planning to integrate jobs, housing, and other daily uses with an efficient transit and active transportation (e.g., walking,  biking, e-scooters) network.

Meeting this goal requires City action to promote transit and active transportation, County and Transportation Planning Organization (TPO) action to implement the SMART Plan, and resident action to voluntarily switch to lower-emissions transportation options as part of their daily lives.

This initiative is also contribution to the Greening Malaysia agenda set by the Federal government where 100 million trees must be planted across the country by 2025. And while it has been quite successful in planting tree saplings, mangrove forest replanting – which is vital to protect coastal areas rich with biodiversity – is proceeding at a much slower pace. Under the state government’s Green Agenda launched last year, Penang aims to plant 500,000 trees in total.  Out of this amount, Penang Island City Council (MBPP) Landscape Department's director Azizul Fahmi Muhamad said that as of April 2022, a total of 103,951 trees had been planted across Penang island since 2008.Additionally, the city council is active in mangrove tree planting even though the state government has not set any real targets for mangrove replanting. According to MBPP, only 7,000 mangrove tree saplings were replanted all over the island including the Balik Pulau Permanent forest reserve from 2020 to May 2022. The reason as to why mangrove forests are important is because they protect the coastline from storms, erosion and tsunamis, create new habitats for marine life such as fish, crabs, shellfish and other species, and encourage biodiversity. Additionally, they help to preserve the marine ecosystem. However, there are challenges because there is a slower pace of replanting is because of the nature of the mangrove plants that to be planted in suitable locations such as coastal margins where land meets water.","Smaller - covers only part of the jurisdiction, please explain exclusions: The initiative is part of a federal target related to Greening Malaysia where 100 Million Trees must be planted by 2025",2021,2021,Question not applicable,number of trees,24767,2025,100000,51938,Question not applicable,"Yes, provide link/attachment: https://www.thestar.com.my/metro/metro-news/2022/07/06/penangs-green-dream","In order to achieve the Greening Agenda target, the council has set a target to plant 20,000 trees per year.

The outcomes sought through the startegy and the City's overarching Sustainable Sydney 2030-2050 strategy, outline strategic goals for a City that has more public transport and zero carbon vehicles and more people choose to walk and ride bikes. The City is to be greener and calmer with more space for people on the streets. The City targets to capture these outcomes are metrics around journey to work transport mode share and access to essential daily needs. Targets arising from the strategy are as follows:– By 2050, people will use public transport, walk or cycle to travel to and from work.

Modal imbalance  is often a direct result of a sprawling pattern of growth and  development that furthers reliance on vehicular travel and  increases inequities in our communities. Successful mode shift  supports City goals around climate, congestion, health, equity,  growth management, and Vision Zero.Charlotte is a car-dependent city. 76.6% of Charlotte workers drive  alone to work. 23.4% travel by some other mode (e.g., walk, bike,  transit, carpool, or telework). That imbalance is a direct result of 1)  Charlotte’s sprawling pattern of growth and development after World  War II and 2) Charlotte’s historic underinvestment in infrastructure  for walking, biking, and riding transit. Charlotte’s car dependence  also reflects other challenging issues, like the lack of a connected  multimodal network, our transportation sector accounting for almost  40% of greenhouse gas emissions (Strategic Energy Action Plan, 2015),  and the fact that the average household in Charlotte spends nearly a  quarter of their income on transportation (HTA Index).Achieving a more balanced mode share is critical to achieving  complicated—and sometimes competing—mobility goals, such as:• Managing rapid growth• Improving multimodal accessibility and safety• Supporting equity, affordability, and health• Responding to climate change• Managing congestionSetting an aspirational mode balance target to guide future  transportation investment and policies should be considered to  achieve citywide mobility goals.",897720,2022,POINT (-80.8431 35.2271),04/03/2024 08:02:05 PM

The efforts made by the City of Paris to support the thermal renovation of housing will have a growing impact as the works progress. With over 230,000 units, the real estate portfolio of Parisian social landlords represents a priority in the sustainable renovation policy for residential properties in Paris. Since 2009, the City of Paris has been supporting the renovation of social housing with an average target of funding 4,500 units per year, which has been raised to 5,000 in the Climate Plan. In 2019, 4,859 social housing units were financed for energy renovation, with a projected average energy gain of 56%. From 2016 to 2019, under the Eco-Rénovons Paris program, 3,811 private units have already received subsidies for renovation works, totaling 18.9 million euros, with 11.2 million euros provided by the City of Paris. This program has supported the energy renovation of 22,150 private units and 10,890 units have already been renovated. Eco-Rénovons Paris has facilitated two-thirds of the total renovations in Paris, accounting for 33,000 units.Energy consumption in the tertiary sector has also seen a 7% decrease between 2004 and 2019, affecting all energy vectors except for district heating, which showed a slight increase. While the City of Paris has limited levers to reduce energy consumption in this sector, engaging tertiary actors remains a key aspect of the Climate Plan, addressed through programs like Paris Action Climat Biodiversité (PACB).As for the goal of gradually phasing out fossil fuels by 2030, natural gas, an imported fossil fuel, remains the primary heating energy in Paris. However, the consumption of fuel oil, the most emitting energy source on the territory, has sharply declined by 46% between 2004 and 2019.see dedicated energy page: https://www.paris.fr/energie",2145906,2022,POINT (2.35222 48.8566),04/03/2024 08:02:05 PM

See page 47.  The Birmingham Solar PV Study report (December 2016) used a GIS analysis to determine the potential for solar rooftop and ground-mounted potential across Birmingham City Council. This has been extrapolated to the rest of the WMCA based on the number of domestic dwellings. The results of this were validated by comparing against regional Western Power Grid projections for 2030 for the West Midlands, based on the Future Energy Scenarios methodology, and adjusted CCC projections for rooftop solar PV potential by 2050 on a national scale. Both showed that an estimate was of the same scale and of reasonable accuracy: 830 MW in comparison to 773 MW from CCC projections and 555 MW from WPD (projected only to 2030).As the Five Year Plan articulates,  co-benefits have been considered as part of this target. Co-benefits include reduction of energy bills for residents so tackling fuel poverty, provide flexibility services to the energy system and back- up power in case of power outages and it creates opportunities for community, municipal and other forms of local ownership of solar PV and storage equipment.",2919600,2021,,04/03/2024 08:02:05 PM

The new garbage truck and bus will bring the City to a total of 19 electric or hybrid vehicles and will provide significant cost and environmental benefits as part of Hoboken's Climate Action Plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  By replacing the garbage truck and bus with electric alternatives, the City will save an estimated $1.1 million in fuel over the next 15 years based on current usage rates, as well as additional cost savings through reduced maintenance and operations compared to the current vehicles. By switching to the two new electric vehicles, the City will also eliminate the consumption of roughly 17,500 gallons of diesel fuel on an annual basis.  The electric vehicles will produce substantially less noise pollution compared to diesel-fueled vehicles and will also reduce nitrogen oxide emissions – a lead contributor to ozone pollution – by approximately 150,000 grams of NOx pollution per year, or almost 2.3 million grams of NOx over the useful life of the electric vehicles.

The City was able to subscribe a portion of eightComEd City building accounts for a total subscription value of 64,987 kilowatt-hours per year. The City launched Illinois’ first municipal-sponsored community solar program offering residents a theability to subscribe to solar farm developments in the ComEd service territory. Residents will have the opportunity to sign up online for community solar subscriptions later this summer. Aninformational mailer from the City will be sent out to each resident once the program becomes available. The program is being offered through the City’s participation in the Metropolitan MayorsCaucus. Lake Forest has participated in SolSmart, a national program recognizing communities for making it easier and more cost-efficient to install and enjoy the benefits of solar energy. In May of 2019 Lake Forest received a bronze designation level that recognizes the City's commitment to promoting solar energy. Additionally, Lake Forest and The Lake Forest Collaborative forEnvironmental Leadership (LFCEL) have provided a forum for residents in February 2019 to advise them on how to take advantage of solar energy for their home.

The preferred scenario involves retrofitting nearly all the residential, commercial and institutional buildings in the Region over a period of 30 years. This objective requires a new and enhanced focus on deep, whole-building retrofits, as well as a new industry and aligns with the Comprehensive Residential Retrofit program recommended in the Durham Community Climate Change Local Action Plan. Air source heat pumps are added to 40% of residential buildings and 30% of commercial buildings by 2050. Ground source heat pumps are added to 20% of residential and 25% of commercial buildings by 2050. By 2050, 80% of all buildings have solar PV systems which provide on average 30% of consumption for building electrical load for less than five (5) storeys; 10% for multiunit buildings greater than five (5) storeys and commercial buildings. By 2050, scale up to 80% of all residential buildings, and 50% of commercial buildings by 2050 that addresses 50% of hot water load in the building.Whitby's Climate Emergency Response Plan: Phase 2: Mitigation which is currently being finalized details an implementation plan that recommends on-site renewable generation by increasing local installation of rooftop solar PV and ground mount solar systems. This action proposes a wide target for renewable energy: 100% of available municipal and non-municipal roof spaces to be equipped with roof-mount solar PV by 2045, and 50% of available parking lots are equipped with ground-mount PV by 2045.","Larger - covers the whole jurisdiction and adjoining areas, please explain additions: The Durham Community Energy Plan covers the entire geography of Durham Region to guide the development, storage & transmission of energy in communities and to optimize the related economic, environmental, health & social benefits.",2019,2016,Percentage (%),none,1,2050,56,2019,56,"Yes, provide link/attachment: Please refer to attachments - Durham Community Energy Plan (DCEP) Executive Summary & Technical Reports for additional details. https://www.durham.ca/en/citystudio/resources/Durham-Community-Energy-Plan-Part-1.pdf","The annual report for evaluating progress across the Region towards Greenhouse Gas reduction targets, advising on future measures and updating community emissions data at the Region-wide scale, and by local area municipality is currently underway.",138501,2021,,04/03/2024 08:02:05 PM

It also provides an opportunity to grow the green economy, create thousands of new jobs and provoke innovation within the sector.Further to the action plan, a data analysis report was commissioned, which provides an assessment of the number of measures required to achieve the home retrofit targets, the trades requirements involved and associated costs. The report provides a cross-tenure analysis based on an assessment of the near 3.8 million homes in the capital.Ensure the new Local Plan is as low carbon as possible•Explore going beyond London Plan standards for carbon neutral developments, with offsetting a last resort•Ensure developments are climate resilient and require the use of sustainable drainage and other flood management systems •Maximise opportunities for on-site renewable energy generation and retrofit •Use placemaking that prioritises sustainable travel and considers a 15-minute city approach to development•Ensure infrastructure is a key component of planning and results in biodiversity net gain•Provide for monitoring of the effectiveness of the Local Plan through regular performance assessment against a series of quantitate indicators•Require development to be ‘air quality neutral’ during construction and operation•Require whole lifecycle emissions assessment from developers, circular economy statements and contributions to the costs of monitoring energy efficiency in line with the GLA’s ‘be seen’ hierarchy and monitoring guidance.",Same - covers entire jurisdiction and nothing else,2020,2021,Question not applicable,Percentage (metric value in base year is current status and metric value in target year is new total percentage - i.e. 97% decrease on base year),100,2038,3,100,Question not applicable,"Yes, provide link/attachment: https://www.londoncouncils.gov.uk/our-key-themes/climate-change/retrofit-london-housing-action-plan","We are unable to attach a document to this question.

A particular challenge for Reading has been to recover public transport services after the pandemic a when the public were discouraged from using public transport services.  As part of the effort to help public transport services recover, in early 2022 the UK Government invited local authorities to develop Bus Service Improvement Plans (BSIP) for their areas and to bid for funding to implement these. Reading has invested heavily in bus priority infrastructure and has retained a municipal bus company when many other local authorities have disposed of theirs. As a result it has one of the best urban bus services outside London, bucking pre-pandemic trends for falling bus use and achieving the second highest level of bus use per head of population  after Brighton & Hove. The Council therefore submitted an ambitious plan for recovery which demonstrated how recovery of bus services had a crucial role to play in meeting its net zero objectives.In April 2022 the Government announced an indicative award of £26 million for Reading to implement its BSIP (£16 million earmarked for bus priority infrastructure and £10 million for bus service enhancements). This was one of the largest of the 31 grant awards announced by the Government. The Council has developed its proposals further for since this time but key elements of Reading's BSIP include:- Investment in key corridors and routes- Integrated local ticketing between operators and across modes- Additional bus priority infrastructure- Further decarbonisation of the bus fleet via electrification- Simpler faresReading's BSIP can be viewed here: https://images.reading.gov.uk/2021/10/Reading-Bus-Service-Improvement-Plan-2021-26-accessible.pdf.",174200,2021,,04/03/2024 08:02:05 PM

The geographical position of Florence, in a valley surrounded by hills, may cause under certain weather conditions the accumulation of pollutants and urban heat islands. With respect to topographical constraints, it should be noted that the urban layout is characterized by very narrow streets, particularly in the historic centre, affecting the dispersion of emissions from traffic.Furthermore, the period from November to March is critical for air quality because of it is characterized by a lowering of the atmosphere mixing layers which does not allow the normal dispersion of pollutants with a consequent increase in concentrations in the lower levels.The overall trend is positive: the values have been decreasing in the last 10 years, the limit values established by the WHO guidelines are generally respected.The PAC2021-2024 intends to plan projects and structural interventions to further reduce pollutant emissions. As regards the structural measures to be planned, they should mainly be aimed at reducing NOX emissions:the implementation of the new tramway segments will  improve air quality and it is possible to value the reduction of NO2,  in 2.4 ton/year. Once the new segments will be completed, the overall benefit will be the reduction of 19 ton/ year in terms of NO2, consequently the value of O3 and PM10 will decrease also.In order to protect public health, in compliance with current legislation, the PRQA pursues the objective of protecting air quality through the general objectives listed below which are set out in the specific objectives of reducing emissions of specific pollutants or their precursors.Its objectives are as follows :•reduce to zero the percentage of the population exposed to exceedances beyond the limit values of NO2 and PM10.•reduce the proportion of the population exposed to pollution levels above the target value for ozone.•maintain good air quality where pollution levels are permanently below the limit values•update and improve the dissemination of information.","Larger - covers the whole jurisdiction and adjoining areas, please explain additions:  Following the territorial classification in zones with common features, the “Florence Agglomeration” includes Florence and adjacent municipalities (Bagno a Ripoli, Campi Bisenzio, Scandicci, Sesto Fiorentino, Calenzano, Lastra a Signa and Signa).",2020,2020,Question not applicable,t NO2/y,44,2030,25,42,Question not applicable,"Yes, provide link/attachment: https://www.comune.fi.it/comunicati-stampa/qualita-dellaria-al-il-nuovo-piano-di-azione-comunale-2021-2024","Arpat Report 2020:http://www.arpat.toscana.it/documentazione/catalogo-pubblicazioni-arpat/relazione-annuale-sullo-stato-della-qualita-dellaria-nella-regione-toscana-anno-2020http://www.arpat.toscana.it/temi-ambientali/aria/emissioni/linventario-regionale-delle-sorgenti-di-emissioni-in-atmosfera-irse#:~:text=in%20atmosfera%20(IRSE)-,L'Inventario%20Regionale%20delle%20Sorgenti%20di%20Emissioni%20in%20atmosfera%20(IRSE,industriali%20che%20civili%20e%20naturali.https://accessoconcertificato.comune.fi.it/trasparenza-atti-allegati/25308/Emendato%20PAC%202021_2024%20Regional Information Campaign:https://www.regione.toscana.it/-/aria-di-toscana",366079,2022,POINT (11.2558 43.7696),04/03/2024 08:02:05 PM

The Strategy offers a range of EV incentives, which currently include: stamp duty waivers, free vehicle registration and no-interest loans of up to $15,000.The summary of other actions in the Strategy include:- Expanding the stamp duty waivers for buyers of used electric and hydrogen vehicles purchased from August 1 this year, cutting the cost of an average second-hand vehicle by around $1600.- $2000 grants for installation of EV charging infrastructure for apartment buildings- Expanding the ACT public charging network to at least 180 EV chargers by 2025- Exclusion of new vehicles powered by fossil-fuels in taxi and ride-share fleets by 2030- Changes to the Territory Plan to make new builds EV ready and streamlining EV charging application processes for public land- 100% of all newly leased Government vehicles are ZEVs where fit for purpose and explore opportunities to replace ACT Government heavy fleet vehicles with ZEVs- Phasing out light internal combustion engine vehicles by 2035- Aiming for 80-90% of light vehicle sales being zero emissions vehicles by 2030.This Strategy focuses on how the ACT Government can encourage the uptake of ZEVs to cut transport emissions and improve air quality.

The efforts made by the City of Paris to support the thermal renovation of housing will have a growing impact as the works progress. With over 230,000 units, the real estate portfolio of Parisian social landlords represents a priority in the sustainable renovation policy for residential properties in Paris. Since 2009, the City of Paris has been supporting the renovation of social housing with an average target of funding 4,500 units per year, which has been raised to 5,000 in the Climate Plan. In 2019, 4,859 social housing units were financed for energy renovation, with a projected average energy gain of 56%. From 2016 to 2019, under the Eco-Rénovons Paris program, 3,811 private units have already received subsidies for renovation works, totaling 18.9 million euros, with 11.2 million euros provided by the City of Paris. This program has supported the energy renovation of 22,150 private units and 10,890 units have already been renovated. Eco-Rénovons Paris has facilitated two-thirds of the total renovations in Paris, accounting for 33,000 units.Energy consumption in the tertiary sector has also seen a 7% decrease between 2004 and 2019, affecting all energy vectors except for district heating, which showed a slight increase. While the City of Paris has limited levers to reduce energy consumption in this sector, engaging tertiary actors remains a key aspect of the Climate Plan, addressed through programs like Paris Action Climat Biodiversité (PACB).As for the goal of gradually phasing out fossil fuels by 2030, natural gas, an imported fossil fuel, remains the primary heating energy in Paris. However, the consumption of fuel oil, the most emitting energy source on the territory, has sharply declined by 46% between 2004 and 2019.see dedicated energy page: https://www.paris.fr/energie",2145906,2022,POINT (2.35222 48.8566),04/03/2024 08:02:05 PM

Inicialmente constaba de un servicio con separación en destino, lo que implicaba que los vecinos de la comuna entregaban un contenedor de manera semanal con todos los residuos potencialmente reciclables mezclados. Luego de varios análisis, se detectó que la eficiencia de este sistema era muy ineficiente debido al alto grado de contaminación cruzada, entre otros factores, por lo que sólo un estimado del 17% de lo enviado a separación era efectivamente reciclado, mientras lo demás era enviado a relleno sanitario.Debido a esto es que se comenzó un piloto de reciclaje con separación en origen, dónde los vecinos separan en tres grandes grupos para ser posteriormente enviados directamente a plantas de valorización. Este proceso de implementación fue implementado en toda la comuna a mitad del año 2022 y estuvo acompañada de acción territorial de difusión y educación ambiental a vecinos a través de capacitaciones. Los resultados obtenidos han sido significativamente mejores, triplicandose en promedio los residuos efectivamente reciclados, con un porcentaje de pureza promedio del 90%, pasando así de un promedio mensual de 56 a 180 toneladas y eliminando los costos asociados al proceso de separación. Actualmente, una de las metas que se busca desde el municipio es el de quintuplicar las toneladas de residuos recicladas a través del programa domiciliario. Esto implica por un lado aumentar la participación de los habitantes de la comuna (se estima que solo alrededor de un 25% participa de este programa) y continuar con la labor educativa que se ha llevado a cabo hasta el momento.

The efforts made by the City of Paris to support the thermal renovation of housing will have a growing impact as the works progress. With over 230,000 units, the real estate portfolio of Parisian social landlords represents a priority in the sustainable renovation policy for residential properties in Paris. Since 2009, the City of Paris has been supporting the renovation of social housing with an average target of funding 4,500 units per year, which has been raised to 5,000 in the Climate Plan. In 2019, 4,859 social housing units were financed for energy renovation, with a projected average energy gain of 56%. From 2016 to 2019, under the Eco-Rénovons Paris program, 3,811 private units have already received subsidies for renovation works, totaling 18.9 million euros, with 11.2 million euros provided by the City of Paris. This program has supported the energy renovation of 22,150 private units and 10,890 units have already been renovated. Eco-Rénovons Paris has facilitated two-thirds of the total renovations in Paris, accounting for 33,000 units.Energy consumption in the tertiary sector has also seen a 7% decrease between 2004 and 2019, affecting all energy vectors except for district heating, which showed a slight increase. While the City of Paris has limited levers to reduce energy consumption in this sector, engaging tertiary actors remains a key aspect of the Climate Plan, addressed through programs like Paris Action Climat Biodiversité (PACB).As for the goal of gradually phasing out fossil fuels by 2030, natural gas, an imported fossil fuel, remains the primary heating energy in Paris.

England’s woodland cover is only 1/4 of that across the rest of Europe.Across the NECF area, woodland cover is just 8.3%.The IPCC advises the UK government to significantly increase its overall woodland cover from 13% to 17% by 2050, and ideally, 19% to support the transition to net zero. The NECF Partnership aims to double tree canopy cover, and plant 500 hectares, by 2025.Sunderland carried out an i-tree canopy cover assessment in 2021 and the total canopy cover across the local authority area is 18.4%. The NECF 2050 target is to achieve 30% tree canopy cover across the forest area. The NECF was launched in February 2022. In the first planting season (2021/22), Sunderland planted 8462 whips; 90 orchard trees (to encourage local growing); 6777 hedge plants across 1360 metres; 7.37ha of wildflower meadow seeding. In the second planting season (2022/23), Sunderland planted 2000 whips; 487 street trees / public realm standard trees; 189 orchard trees; 2412 hedge plants across 400m; 2.48ha of wildflower meadow seeding; 14000 bulbs.

At its core, this program is dedicated to tackling the persistent and escalating challenge of indiscriminate disposal of used cooking oil, an issue plaguing many food establishments and households. The wanton disposal of used cooking oil into the city's drainage system and water bodies has prompted this innovative solution.The essence of the program lies in its capacity to collect and recycle used cooking oil, transforming it into eco-friendly Biodiesel Fuel. The significance of biodiesel cannot be overstated, considering that it is both renewable and biodegradable. This biofuel also contributes significantly to reducing harmful emissions into the environment, thus presenting a sustainable alternative to the conventional fossil fuels.In essence, the Davao City BDF Processing Facility is an environmentally conscientious initiative, aiming to not only manage used cooking oil responsibly but also to harness it as a resource for cleaner, more sustainable energy production.",Same - covers entire jurisdiction and nothing else,2019,2017,Question not applicable,Liters,13974,2030,72102.77,13974,Question not applicable,No,"In October 2017, the city initiated the collection of used cooking oil at the barangay level. To ensure a consistent supply of used oil, the city collaborated with local restaurants and fast-food establishments. Approximately 10 percent of the collected oil serves as a raw material for breaking down biodegradable wastes into compost, contributing to waste reduction efforts.An essential objective of this program is to decrease the presence of cooking oil in the city's waterways and canals, as excessive oil can coagulate and exacerbate flooding issues. To further support this initiative, the City Environment and Natural Resources Office (CENRO) urges all Dabawenyos not to dispose of their used cooking oil but to gather it. Local authorities at the barangay level are responsible for collecting this oil from each household. Subsequently, the collected oil is transferred to the city's oil refinery located at the CENRO composting facility in Barangay Ma-a.For barangays equipped with their waste collection vehicles, there is an opportunity to avail biodiesel subsidies from CENRO if they deliver their collected wastes to the city's sanitary landfills. Notably, some barangays like Hizon, Mintal, and Sasa have already established their used cooking oil collection system. Encouraging all barangays to participate and establish their oil collection scheme is a key focus for CENRO.The city's biodiesel fuel plant, funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), has been remarkably productive, producing nearly 200,000 liters of biodiesel since its launch in August 2017 until April 2022.

Monitoring of NO2 undertaken during 2022 indicates that there are some exceedances of the NO2 annual mean objective, all AQMAs showed an average reduction in NO2 levels compared to 2019. Of the nine AQMAs in 2022, four showed exceedances of the annul mean objective, compared to six in 2019. Bodmin, Camborne/Pool/Redruth, Grampound, St Austell and Camelford each had no exceedances in 2022.There is a long term trend of a reduction in NO2 concentrations across all AQMAs, concentrations in 2022 have generally reduced compared to 2019 however concentrations in 2022 were generally higher compared to 2021 and 2020. 2020 concentrations decreased much more as a result of the pandemic.  2021 concentrations have increased on these 2020 levels however 2021 was also impacted by the pandemic with a national lockdown for over 3 months of the year.  Where robust monitoring shows concentrations consistently below the objective, consideration will be given to revoking an AQMA and 2022 data will inform these decisions.

The efforts made by the City of Paris to support the thermal renovation of housing will have a growing impact as the works progress. With over 230,000 units, the real estate portfolio of Parisian social landlords represents a priority in the sustainable renovation policy for residential properties in Paris. Since 2009, the City of Paris has been supporting the renovation of social housing with an average target of funding 4,500 units per year, which has been raised to 5,000 in the Climate Plan. In 2019, 4,859 social housing units were financed for energy renovation, with a projected average energy gain of 56%. From 2016 to 2019, under the Eco-Rénovons Paris program, 3,811 private units have already received subsidies for renovation works, totaling 18.9 million euros, with 11.2 million euros provided by the City of Paris. This program has supported the energy renovation of 22,150 private units and 10,890 units have already been renovated. Eco-Rénovons Paris has facilitated two-thirds of the total renovations in Paris, accounting for 33,000 units.Energy consumption in the tertiary sector has also seen a 7% decrease between 2004 and 2019, affecting all energy vectors except for district heating, which showed a slight increase. While the City of Paris has limited levers to reduce energy consumption in this sector, engaging tertiary actors remains a key aspect of the Climate Plan, addressed through programs like Paris Action Climat Biodiversité (PACB).As for the goal of gradually phasing out fossil fuels by 2030, natural gas, an imported fossil fuel, remains the primary heating energy in Paris. However, the consumption of fuel oil, the most emitting energy source on the territory, has sharply declined by 46% between 2004 and 2019.see dedicated energy page: https://www.paris.fr/energie",2145906,2022,POINT (2.35222 48.8566),04/03/2024 08:02:05 PM

From 2018 to 2021 the area exceeding 40ug/m3 has reduced from 70% to 6%. Therefore the objective was met in 2021, with the caveat that NO2 concentrations in 2020 and 2021 have been impacted through covid restrictions and changing working patterns and traffic volumes.The primary source of NO2 has historically been from vehicle emissions and the continual development of the London LEZ, and subsequent ULEZ, driving the overturn in vehicle fleet to vehicles to higher Euro classes. Within the City Corporation an Air Quality Strategy has been in place since 2011 and is updated every four years. The Strategy outlines a high number of actions that have been developed to reduce NO2 concentrations, these are split across a number of different delivery areas:- Air Quality Monitoring- Leading by Example- Collaborating with Others- Reducing Emissions from Road Transport- Reducing Emissions from Non-Transport- Public Health and Raising Awareness",8600,2021,,04/03/2024 08:02:05 PM

Currently, there is no formal and official definition for energy poverty in Canada. However, it is most commonly characterized in terms of high home energy cost burdens, and using concepts such as affordability. Most households in Canada spend less than 3% of their after-tax income on their energy needs. Households that spend more than twice this value (i.e. more than 6% of their income) on securing access are thought to experience disproportionately high home energy cost burdens. The City of Toronto is currently working on addressing energy poverty as part of the City's Poverty Reduction Strategy which will be released November of 2023.

Projects capturing carbon pollution: We have several projects underway that capture carbon, from growing our urban forest to New Brighton Park Shoreline Habitat restoration project.The added tree canopy has other benefits, including improved resident well-being and reduced energy costs for cooling (as summers heat up with climate change). Likewise, restoration of natural shorelines can reduce flood risk, capture carbon, and increase habitat toward biodiversity goals.While these projects are great local examples, they are not at the scale required to meet Vancouver’s anticipated carbon capture targets. Larger projects outside the city’s boundaries will be sought to complement local efforts.

The council and operators have a strong track record of working through the partnership to deliver improvements to bus services. Operators have innovated and invested heavily to deliver high quality, frequent services, which in many parts of the country is not the case.

In this way, the City aims at achieving the targets set by the EU in the Circular Economy Package (Directive 2018/851). Based on urban characteristics, population density and attendance (tourists, city users, etc.), the territory of the city of Florence has thus been divided into zones, each of which has been associated with the most appropriate type of collection.

The project includes the industrial strategy of Alia in relation to the availability and strengthening of the plants for the most important recycling chains: Paper; Glass; biomethane; plastic granule; biofuels; bulky waste.The objectives of the project were analyzed in terms of the environmental impacts and benefits generated by the management of urban waste collected in the city of Florence, comparing the starting state (year 2019) with the future scenario (2024 fully operational), through the application of the LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) method. The impacts for the 3 macro-categories of the integrated waste cycle (Collection and transport; Treatment and recovery; Final disposal), generated a forecast of the total impact of the “Firenze Città Circolare” project on Climate Change with a reduction of approximately 23.5 million kg of C02, equal to a reduction of 67% of emissions compared to the starting data.",Same - covers entire jurisdiction and nothing else,2020,2019,Question not applicable,t/y for each fraction of waste and t CO2,35074,2024,23500,35074,Question not applicable,"Yes, provide link/attachment: https://www.firenzecittacircolare.it","Florence is deeply committed in the path towards circularity, it signed the City Declaration on Plastic Free (2019), the Circular City Declaration ( https://circularcitiesdeclaration.eu/cities/florence  2020) and the Green City Accord (2021).

This policy, which went into effect in June 2021, will all but eliminate operational emissions from new buildings – nearly 10 years ahead of the City’s commitment – and prevents natural gas emissions that otherwise could have been locked in for decades to come. The transition for existing buildings will be much more challenging and will require inclusive engagement with a broad spectrum of stakeholders to co-create and deliver the necessary suite of policies, education, and funding support for an equitable transition. These solutions must consider the city’s diverse building stock, deferred maintenance, and substandard electrical connections, while also acknowledging that approximately two thirds of residents are renters who will need protections against rent increases, disruption, and displacement. Continuing to pursue and implement cost-effective energy efficiency is also crucial to realize important benefits while making electrification more affordable. In retrofitting existing buildings, key barriers include the cost of new appliances, workforce readiness, and electrical panel upgrades and capacity. Yet, every existing building will experience advantageous moments for decarbonization over the coming years – and success will require foresight to act on opportunities as they arise. For instance, roughly 7%  of energy-using equipment is replaced each year as boilers, heaters and other equipment age. Key opportunities for upgrading to efficient and all-electric equipment include during renovation or seismic retrofit, when a property is sold, or replacing equipment at the end of its useful life. Decarbonizing at these moments will minimize costs and present natural inflection points for incentives and other policy interventions.",808437,2022,POINT (-122.419 37.7749),04/03/2024 08:02:05 PM

It is measured by assessing the traffic development on a three-year moving average. It is the traffic level in the reference year 2018 with which it is compared.Previously, a sliding index over three years was calculated by multiplying the last three annual indices. In order to get a monthly update, the last three indices for the ""last 12 months"" were used. With this methodology, no comparison was made with the reference year. This calculation methodology works well when the traffic development follows a steady trend over many years. But as a result of the pandemic, the level of traffic was generally somewhat lower than normal and there was a clear trend break against what has been steady traffic growth for several decades. When the pandemic was over, the traffic level rose relatively quickly back to roughly the level it was before. Such a three-year sliding index will thus, during a transitional period, unilaterally absorb the increase from the low level of traffic during the pandemic and will appear as if traffic has generally increased sharply.The new calculation method therefore takes an average of the traffic level over the past three years and compares this with the traffic level in the reference year. Average daily traffic is used for each of the traffic registration points included in the city index. In order for this three-year sliding index to be updated monthly, the average 24-hour traffic per month, known as monthly 24-hour traffic, is used.URL: https://www.vegvesen.no/globalassets/fag/trafikk/trafikkdata/byindeks_bergen_2018-2023-04.pdf",289330,2022,,04/03/2024 08:02:05 PM

The objective is in the short term zero increase in consumption for the 2020-2024 measurement period in order to implement the necessary infrastructure actions although the population, urbanization and construction increase.  By continuing only with the previous policies regarding the sustainable use of energy, the country could continue increasing final energy consumption reaching 6,182 PJ in 2024, derived from greater demand for energy in the residential, transportation, industrial, agricultural and commercial-service sectors and inertially could reach a consumption of 8,470 PJ in 2040. This would mean that if the economy grew at an annual average of 2.8% and the population maintains its growth rate, the energy intensity of final consumption would decrease annually by 0.4% between 2020 and 2024, compared to0.9% which corresponds to the average of the period 2010-2017. Positioning the optimal use of energy through the objectives and actions of this Program, represents a lever to stabilize the growth of national energy consumption, preserve the environment and reduce imports of energy, improve the well-being of the population, increase the productivity of industry and productive companies in the state. Therefore, it is necessary to accelerate the contribution of energy efficiency to the country and avoid a 16% increase in the final energy consumption by 2024 and 34.9% in 2040, through the capture of feasible technical energy saving potentials identified in the different sectors of final energy consumption. At the same time it means that Mexico could reduce its final energy intensity in the short term by a maximum of 2.7% annually, so Mexico is in a position to meet the objectives of the United Nations 2030 agenda, in particular with objective 7.3 in relation to doubling the rate global improvement of energy efficiency towards 2030.",936263,2020,POINT (-110.961 29.0892),04/03/2024 08:02:05 PM

(2) Bring walkable, complete neighbourhoods city-wide with the Vancouver Plan, which is soon to be decided upon by council. Low-cost sustainable transportation options will be easy, safe, and reliable. People will live in walkable complete neighbourhoods and can get to work, school, and other destinations without needing to rely on gas and diesel vehicles. There will be less noise and pollution. By 2030, Vancouverites will notice: You're able to meet more of your daily needs in your neighbourhood",Same - covers entire jurisdiction and nothing else,2020,2020,Question not applicable,"Note that while this is a land use target, it will lead to an increase in active transit which is a zero carbon activity.
